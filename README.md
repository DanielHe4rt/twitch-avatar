# Twitch Avatar

A simple way to find your favorite streamer avatar.

## Why code that

Since Twitch doesn't have a endpoint to retrieve the streamer's avatar easily like "twitch.tv/danielhe4rt.png", me as a
developer that loves the platform and also the environment decided to make it a reality.

## Usage

Go to your browser and search for the URL above to retrieve the latest version of a specific streamer's avatar.

```
https://twitch-avatar.dev/{username}.png
```
