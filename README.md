# Twitch Avatar

A simple way to find your favorite streamer avatar.

[![Laravel Forge Site Deployment Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforge.laravel.com%2Fsite-badges%2F41d7e568-4696-4ab4-b2b2-0995e6c88109%3Fdate%3D1&style=plastic)](https://forge.laravel.com/servers/724245/sites/2181916)
## Why code that

Since Twitch doesn't have a endpoint to retrieve the streamer's avatar easily like "twitch.tv/danielhe4rt.png", me as a
developer that loves the platform and also the environment decided to make it a reality.

## Usage

Go to your browser and search for the URL above to retrieve the latest version of a specific streamer's avatar.

```
https://twitch-avatar.dev/{username}.png
```
